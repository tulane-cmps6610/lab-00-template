# CMPS 6610  Lab 0

In this recitation, we will get warmed up with course resources and do a couple of exercises. 

Some prompts will require you to edit `main.py` and others will require answers will go in `answers.md`.

Refer back to the [README.md](README.md) for instruction on git, how to test your code, and how to submit properly to get all the points you've earned.

1. Set up an account on [Diderot](https://diderot.one/courses/144) (using the access code OMSCS). To verify that you are successful, [post something](https://diderot.one/courses/144/post-office/) on Diderot. This is where you can ask questions and interact on any textbook content.


2. From the discussion in lab, summarize the model of computation that we will be working with in this class. What is the main difference between this class and "traditional" algorithms' classes in terms of the model of computation?

    **Enter your answer in answers.md**

3. From our discussion, summarize what it means for an algorithm to be efficient.

    **Enter your answer in answers.md**


4.  Let's do some simple coding in Python. In `main.py`, complete the implementation of linear search with a partner using an IDE of your choice. You can test your implementation using the provided tests.
